## RSS?

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed that allows users and apps to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format.

subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single RSS feed reader, which constantly monitor sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them.


## demo?

here is a screenshot of my RSS reader, which has many feeds for blogs and news.

this makes very easy to get updates on stuff

### readers

open source RSS readers:

### feeds

a RSS feed is a URL that hosts the updates and new content, here are some examples:

`https://lastgenerationz.github.io/index.xml` is the URL for all posts on this website
`https://lastgenerationz.github.io/categories/daily/index.xml` is the feed for just daily posts on this website


#### popular sources

[RSSHub](https://docs.rsshub.app/) is "capable of generating RSS feeds from pretty much everything," like getting updates from twitter, telegram, news sites, blogs...

you can also find RSS feeds is from a browser extension that searches for feeds on a website, or you can search for RSS feeds on the website yourself.

## afterword
