## intro

well, we have read about augmented reality for years...

augmented reality is an interesting technology

around 2013, there were experimental AR devices like hololens and google glass...

the concept was that AR glasses should be similar in size to regular glasses


## technology requirements

to make some features, AR glasses would have sensors like radar, camera and microphone. not only so, but the glasses would need great computational power to recognize the surrounding environment.

although phones can be used to help with computational power, the glasses itself should also have enough resources

battery consumption has to be optimized enough

there also has to be many pieces of software - you can't expect to only use your futuristic AR glasses to do trivial things like checking the time.


## features

image and video capturing are very useful features

real time translation and transcription would be one of the most useful features of AR glasses

## technologies

let's see what technologies AR glasses use.

### microled

[microled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroLED) has greatly reduced energy requirements compared to normal LED, greater brightness, longer lifetime, and better color accuracy.

normally the microled stuff are "grown" from sheets; red, blue and green microled things are grown seperately, after which they get lasered onto the same sheet.

however, as the space between diodes get to as low as 1 micrometer, merging becomes impossible...

a design made by [jade bird display](https://www.jb-display.com/technology.html)had the sheets attached to a cube prism to form what's called a "polychrome microled projector," which is a useful design


### chip

ARM chips were used because of how customizable and small they are. this made battery life short and awkward to incorporate the useful features customers would want in AR glasses like user interfaces and "smart" controls.

a more economically suitable approach would be to modify some phone chips because they are used similarly

AR glasses could totally use the assistance of phones through wifi and bluetooth though

### battery

even if AR glasses use good batteries, it would still be inconvenient to, you know, take them off for 10 minutes while waiting for them to charge.

detachable batteries could be a nice solution
