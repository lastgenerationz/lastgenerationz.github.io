Rather, assuming and indeed, embracing the ambiguity that defines an individual life, and recognizing that the individual is always already amidst a world populated by other individuals, her questions would center on the problems of intersubjectivity and the possibility of recognition. Could the other ever be seen as the self? Could it be seen and understood as at one and the same time being self and other, subject and object, immanence and transcendence? And could the other simultaneously see the self in all its complexity not reducing it to either a pure subjectivity or a pure objectivity? What would be the conditions for the possibility of such recognition? And could mutual recognition of this sort move beyond being a theoretical possibility posited on the pages of philosophical essays and explored in novels to being a lived experience?

It was thought of at the theoretical level (metaphysics) as well as within the realm of lived experience (phenomenology), the possibility for a self, a subject, to find itself, at home in the other.

However, it is always only a possibility. Self and other are engaged in an ongoing “battle to the death.” Hence, this reading of Hegel presupposes that between subject and object there cannot be love, friendship and generosity but only conflict and hostility.
