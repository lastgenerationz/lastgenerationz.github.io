## what is the fire fortune?

"fire fortune", directly translated from the chinese term "火运", is a 20-year period of time that spans from the year 2024 to 2044.

in a nutshell, this means that the "fortune" of the world has just changed from "earth" to "fire," meaning dramatic changes in the fortune of the world during these 20 years.

"火，有气有温度，但却无形虚无的东西。" - fire, with gas and temperature, but without shape or form.

of course, the fire fortune doesn't mean literal fire, but rather is a metaphor for abstract but influential things, like the internet, developments in AI, and the flourishing of human ideas and creativity.

females would... have incredible fortune and achieve great things in the world? nice!

also, beauty will flourish in the lands.

## some things to consider

here are some theories that i've gathered across the references.

the restaurant dining industry will become more popular?

the world will become more transparent and free? (hopefully)

more people would have near-sightedness?

heart conditions become more common and widespread?

more people would practise spirituality and mindfulness?

marriages are under stress becuase of heated-up arguments?

technological advances will be very quick? (well sure)

...

i can't know all this for sure because it's all just theory. theory fron hundreds and hundreds of years ago that may or may not prove accurate or useful to us.

*sigh*

i know one thing for sure...

the world is going to unveil an exciting new chapter.

> Douglas Adams:
> “I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
> 1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
> 2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
> 3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.”

for more information, feel free to browse the references.
