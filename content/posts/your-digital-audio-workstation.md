music making has always been a difficult hobby.

you have many instruments, and then you have drums and vocals... how do you handle it all?

a few demonstrations of what it's like to make music:

artists always use a digital audio workstation (abbreviated DAW) to compose tracks, which then would be configured for volume levels, instrument presets, and audio filters. it's amazing how much content there is in a single song.

for some remarkable examples of music making, see some [featured sequences from onlinesequencer.net](https://onlinesequencer.net/members/9000)

## installing a digital audio workstation

now, i hope you are prepared to dive into the world of music making...

first up, you will need a digital audio workstation.

as described in my post on [music-freedom](https://lastgenerationz.github.io/posts/music-freedom), it would be best to use a digital audio workstation that supports importing and exporting MIDI files.

i recommend using <https://helio.fm> as it is the best digital audio workstation i have ever seen.



## installing instruments

like playing music in your garage, you will need instruments. real instruments get *really* expensive and also hard to work with :/

anyways, in digital audio workstations we use Virtual Studio Technology (VST) to simulate virtual instruments and acoustic effects. a similar format called Audio Unit (AU) was designed by apple, and made to be installed on mac computers.

these audio plugins are quite expensive to purchase though, but choosing the right audio plugins are essential to making your music sound unique. there are just so many different sounds that a digital instrument can synthesize...

## using a digital audio workstation

making music is hard.

uaing a digital audio workstation is hard... though helio is really easy to use and has a great intuitive interface that should be easy to use
(actually relatively speaking)

when you start composing for a while you realize that it's a very creative form of art and it's an entire world of musical expressiveness and you are the bandmaster...

sigh, no matter how much i use a digital audio workstation, there'll always be some feature that makes composing a tiny bit easier or more customizable.
i don't mind though; most of the time i feel content just tinkering around with tracks and combinations.

it's a big pain to choose the instrument that sounds just right for the particular purpose you have in mind.
sometimes it takes an hour just to find the right instrument configuration for a track; the volume might be off or the pitch may sound too sharp.

## conclusion?

that's currently all i have to say.
i'll continuously update this post in the future!
